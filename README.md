ripple-coins
============

A collection of Node.js modules to facilitate integration &amp; automation of new coins into a ripple gateway


## Ripple Coins - A universal gatewayd cryptocurrency integration and automation framework

  - That sure is a mouthful. It's a connector for gatewayd for all coins (or a very large majority).

##Progress
1. Withdrawal processing
  - Finished but needs to be polished. (Thanks for the help, McShane!)
2. Deposit processing
  - ~~See Issues 1,2,3.~~ Deposit processing is being developed by Steven [here](https://github.com/stevenzeiler/blockchain-account-monitor) and in our fork [here](https://github.com/RoastBeefSandwichCo/blockchain-account-monitor). On completion, I aim to unify them. Thanks for still MORE fabulous work, man. You are win.

## Dependencies

1. [Gatewayd](https://github.com/ripple/gatewayd)
  - Provides easy deposit and withdrawal management (and endpoints in Ripple REST)
  - Provides [Node.js](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager), [Ripple REST API](https://github.com/ripple/ripple-rest.git)

2. [node-rest-client](https://www.npmjs.org/package/node-rest-client)
  - Easy interfacing with gatewayd api

3. [node-bitcoin](https://www.npmjs.org/package/bitcoin)
  - Node module providing *coin connection objects
  - Moving to [node-dogecoin](https://www.npmjs.org/package/node-dogecoin)!

4. [A cryptocurrency daemon](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin)(local or remote)
  - These modules aim to be crypto-agnostic, so any daemon with (the de facto standard) bitcoin-compatible RPC calls (sendtoaddress, sendfromaccount...) should do.

## Installation
 - Development: clone the repo inside the gatewayd folder (consistent paths). Note the new development branch which is pretty much guaranteed to be broken. :D
   - Install the dependencies in the cloned source folder. Node package on wishlist.
 - Production: npm install inside gatewayd folder.
 
## Tests

Run this tests with mocha

    npm install -g mocha
    mocha -R spec test/

## Usage
 - During development
   - With Gatewayd, started, execute `node withdrawal-manager.js` to start 

##Processes:
 1. Automatically pay out externally (cryptocurrency to user crypto address) on notice of withdrawal
   - Poll the RESTful API every 1s (default) or listen for ledger close (rippled api using ripple-lib remote), then check [pending_withdrawals](https://github.com/ripple/gatewayd#listing-withdrawals) (RESTful API endpoint provided by gatewayd)
   - Send [RPC request](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Original_Bitcoin_client/API_calls_list) to coin daemon via node-bitcoin
   - [Clear withdrawal](https://github.com/ripple/gatewayd#clearing-a-withdrawal) using RESTful API
 2. Automatically issue IOUs for external deposits (cryptocurrency from user to own crypto address)
   - Listen to coin daemon for received transactions
   - On receipt of assets, submit deposit using gatewayd.data.models.externalAccounts and gatewayd.data.models.externalTransactions [as seen on TV](https://github.com/RoastBeefSandwichCo/blockchain-account-monitor/blob/master/test/processor-snippet.js)


## TODO:
 - List unsupported coins

##CAVEAT:
 - Ninobrooks is a javascript noob and makes no pretense that his code is elegant or purdy. He in fact welcomes (begs) others to clean it up and improve it. The only reason he's doing this in the first place is because far more talented people have had more pressing matters to attend to. Also, he's going to stop talking about himself in the third person.

##Thanks!
 - To everyone who donates, contributes code, or has developed a module I'm using. In particular (and besides Ripple Labs in general), thank you Steven Zeiler and others for all your work on gatewayd, and freewil and company for node-bitcoin which has saved me quite some work.

##Donate
  - Presently, raising funds for hardware upgrades. If you would like to donate hardware, please contact me directly!
